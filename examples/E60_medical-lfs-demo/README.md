# Medical LFS Demo (E60)

This demo showcases LFS (Large File Support) for healthcare workloads, demonstrating the **content explosion pattern** with DICOM-like medical imaging data.

## Quick Start

```bash
make medical-lfs-demo
```

## What This Demonstrates

- **Large blob handling**: 500MB+ DICOM-like medical images stored in S3 via LFS
- **Content explosion pattern**: Single upload spawns multiple derived topics
- **Metadata extraction**: Patient ID, modality, study date extracted to separate topic
- **Audit trail**: Access events logged for compliance
- **Checksum verification**: SHA256 integrity validation

## Architecture

```
DICOM Upload ──► LFS Proxy ──► S3 (blob) + Kafka (pointer)
                                    │
                    ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
                    ▼               ▼               ▼
            medical-images    medical-meta    medical-audit
            (LFS pointer)     (patient info)  (access log)
```

## Content Explosion Topics

| Topic | Purpose | Contains LFS? |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `medical-images` | Original DICOM blob pointer | Yes |
| `medical-metadata` | Patient ID, modality, study info | No |
| `medical-audit` | Access timestamps, user actions | No |

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MEDICAL_DEMO_NAMESPACE` | `kafscale-medical` | Kubernetes namespace |
| `MEDICAL_DEMO_BLOB_SIZE` | `524288000` (500MB) | DICOM blob size |
| `MEDICAL_DEMO_BLOB_COUNT` | `3` | Number of studies to upload |
| `MEDICAL_DEMO_CLEANUP` | `1` | Cleanup resources after demo |

      S3 blobs found: 3

      medical-images: 3 LFS pointers
      medical-metadata: 3 patient records
      medical-audit: 9 access events
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### Radiology Department
- CT/MRI scans uploaded by technicians
- Automatic metadata extraction for PACS integration
- Audit trail for HIPAA compliance

### Pathology Lab
- Whole slide images (1-5GB) stored efficiently
- AI inference results written to derived topic
- Chain of custody maintained via audit log

### Telehealth Platform
- Remote diagnostic imaging from clinics
- Real-time availability via Kafka consumers
- Compliance-ready access logging

## Why Healthcare Buyers Care

1. **Compliance**: HIPAA requires audit trails - built into the pattern
2. **Size**: Medical images are inherently large - LFS handles this
3. **Integrity**: SHA256 checksums ensure no corruption
4. **Auditability**: Every access is logged automatically

## Next Steps

- Connect to real DICOM source (Orthanc, dcm4chee)
- Add real metadata extraction with pydicom
- Integrate with Iceberg processor for analytics
- Add AI inference fan-out topic
