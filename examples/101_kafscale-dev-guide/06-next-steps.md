# Next Steps

Congratulations! 🎉 You've successfully set up KafScale locally and connected your Spring Boot application to it.

**Recommended next steps** (in order):

1. **[Monitoring and Observability](#monitoring-and-observability)** - Understand metrics and logging before production
2. **[Moving to Production](#moving-to-production)** - Deploy to Kubernetes with Helm
3. **[Security Considerations](#security-considerations)** - Enable TLS/SASL authentication
4. **[Backup and Recovery](#backup-and-recovery)** - Protect etcd and S3 data

**Optional explorations**:
- [Stream Processing](#advanced-topics) - Try Flink or Spark demos ([E30](07-flink-wordcount-demo.md), [E40](08-spark-wordcount-demo.md))
- [Performance Tuning](#performance-tuning) - Optimize for your workload
- [Multi-Region Deployment](#advanced-topics) - Global deployments

## Moving to Production

The local and kind demos are great for development and testing, but for production deployments, you'll want to use Kubernetes.

### Kubernetes Deployment

KafScale is designed to run on Kubernetes with the KafScale Operator. See the main [Quickstart Guide](../quickstart.md) for Kubernetes deployment instructions.

**Key differences from Docker setup**:
- **etcd cluster**: 3+ nodes for high availability
- **Real S3**: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage
- **Broker scaling**: Multiple broker pods with HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaling)
- **Operator**: Manages broker lifecycle and configuration
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics

### Production Configuration

For production, you'll need to configure:

1. **S3 Bucket**:
```yaml
spec:
  s3:
    bucket: kafscale-prod-us-east-1
    region: us-east-1
    kmsKeyArn: arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789:key/...
    credentialsSecretRef:
      name: kafscale-s3-credentials
```

2. **etcd Cluster**:
```yaml
spec:
  etcd:
    endpoints:
      - https://etcd-0.etcd.svc:2379
      - https://etcd-1.etcd.svc:2379
      - https://etcd-2.etcd.svc:2379
```

3. **Broker Replicas**:
```yaml
spec:
  brokers:
    replicas: 3
```

See [Operations Guide](../operations.md) for detailed production setup.

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics

KafScale exposes Prometheus metrics on port 9093 (platform demo) or 39093 (local demo):

```bash
curl http://localhost:9093/metrics
```

**Key metrics to monitor**:
- `kafscale_produce_requests_total` - Total produce requests
- `kafscale_fetch_requests_total` - Total fetch requests
- `kafscale_s3_upload_duration_seconds` - S3 upload latency
- `kafscale_segment_flush_duration_seconds` - Segment flush time

### Grafana Dashboards

KafScale includes pre-built Grafana dashboards. See [docs/grafana/](../grafana/) for dashboard JSON files.

### Logging

Configure structured logging for production:

```yaml
environment:
  - KAFSCALE_LOG_LEVEL=info
  - KAFSCALE_LOG_FORMAT=json
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

For production, enable authentication:

1. **TLS/SSL**: Encrypt traffic between clients and brokers
2. **SASL**: Authenticate clients (SASL/PLAIN, SASL/SCRAM)
3. **mTLS**: Mutual TLS for broker-to-etcd communication

See [Security Guide](../security.md) for configuration details.

### S3 Bucket Security

1. **Enable versioning**: Protect against accidental deletion
2. **Enable encryption**: Use SSE-KMS with customer-managed keys
3. **Bucket policies**: Restrict access to KafScale service account only
4. **Lifecycle policies**: Archive old segments to Glacier

### etcd Security

1. **Enable TLS**: Encrypt etcd communication
2. **Authentication**: Use client certificates or username/password
3. **RBAC**: Limit permissions to KafScale namespace only

## Backup and Recovery

### S3 Data

S3 data is already durable (11 9's), but consider:

1. **Cross-region replication**: For disaster recovery
2. **Lifecycle policies**: Move old data to cheaper storage classes
3. **Versioning**: Enable to recover from accidental deletes

### etcd Backups

Backup etcd regularly:

```bash
etcdctl snapshot save /backup/etcd-snapshot.db
```

The KafScale operator can automate etcd snapshots to S3.

## Advanced Topics

### Stream Processing

KafScale is designed to work with external stream processing engines:

- **[Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org)**: Stateful stream processing
- **[Apache Wayang](https://wayang.apache.org)**: Cross-platform data processing
- **[Apache Spark Streaming](https://spark.apache.org/streaming/)**: Micro-batch processing

### Multi-Region Deployment

For global deployments:

1. **Primary region**: Write to S3 bucket in primary region
2. **Read replicas**: Configure brokers in other regions to read from replicated bucket
3. **Cross-region replication**: Use S3 CRR to replicate data

See [Architecture Guide](../architecture.md) for details.

### Custom Metrics and Monitoring

Integrate KafScale metrics with your observability stack:

- **Prometheus**: Scrape metrics from port 9093
- **Datadog**: Use Prometheus integration
- **New Relic**: Use Prometheus remote write
- **Grafana Cloud**: Use Prometheus remote write

## Performance Tuning

### Broker Configuration

Tune broker performance:

```yaml
environment:
  - KAFSCALE_SEGMENT_BYTES=67108864        # 64MB segments
  - KAFSCALE_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS=5000        # Flush every 5s
  - KAFSCALE_CACHE_BYTES=1073741824        # 1GB cache
  - KAFSCALE_READAHEAD_SEGMENTS=3          # Prefetch 3 segments
```

### Client Configuration

Optimize your Spring Boot application:

```properties
# Producer tuning
spring.kafka.producer.properties.batch.size=65536
spring.kafka.producer.properties.linger.ms=100
spring.kafka.producer.compression-type=snappy

# Consumer tuning
spring.kafka.consumer.properties.fetch.min.bytes=10240
spring.kafka.consumer.properties.fetch.max.wait.ms=500
spring.kafka.listener.concurrency=10
```

## Comparison with Other Solutions

### KafScale vs Traditional Kafka

| Feature | Traditional Kafka | KafScale |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| Storage | Local disks | S3 object storage |
| Broker state | Stateful | Stateless |
| Scaling | Complex | Simple (just add pods) |
| Cost | High (provisioned disks) | Low (pay for usage) |
| Latency | Very low (1-5ms) | Low (10-50ms) |
| Transactions | Yes | No |
| Compaction | Yes | No |

### KafScale vs WarpStream

Both use S3-backed storage, but:

- **KafScale**: Open source, Kubernetes-native, etcd for metadata
- **WarpStream**: Commercial, proprietary metadata store

### KafScale vs Redpanda

- **Redpanda**: C++ implementation, local storage, low latency
- **KafScale**: Go implementation, S3 storage, cloud-native

## When to Use What
