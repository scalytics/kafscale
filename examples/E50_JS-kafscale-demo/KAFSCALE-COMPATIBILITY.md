# KafScale Compatibility Guide

This document explains how this demo is configured to work optimally with KafScale's single-broker architecture.

## Understanding the Architecture Difference

### Apache Kafka (Multi-Broker)
```
Client connects to: kafka1:9092, kafka2:9092, kafka3:9092
├─ Broker ID 0: kafka1:9092
├─ Broker ID 1: kafka2:9092
└─ Broker ID 2: kafka3:9092

Metadata contains distinct endpoints for each broker
Client can route to specific brokers
```

### KafScale (Single Logical Broker)
```
Client connects to: 127.0.0.1:29092
└─ Logical Broker (infinite scaling behind single endpoint)
   ├─ Object storage for durability
   ├─ Stateless workers
   └─ Metadata abstraction

Metadata may reference broker IDs but all route through one address
Client must treat as single logical broker
```

## Why KafkaJS Requires Special Configuration

KafkaJS makes assumptions based on traditional Kafka:
1. **Stable broker IDs** - Each broker ID maps to a unique endpoint
2. **Direct broker routing** - Can connect to specific broker.id
3. **Static metadata** - Brokers don't disappear/reappear
4. **Multi-broker coordination** - Handles rebalancing across brokers

KafScale breaks assumption #1 and #2:
- Multiple broker IDs may map to the same endpoint
- Or broker IDs are abstracted entirely
- Routing is handled by the platform, not the client

**Result:** KafkaJS can get confused trying to route to broker.id = 1 when it only knows about 127.0.0.1:29092

## The Error You Saw

```
KafkaJSBrokerNotFound: Broker 1 not found in the cached metadata
TimeoutNegativeWarning: -1767887275900 is a negative number
```

### What Happened
1. KafkaJS connected to `127.0.0.1:29092` ✅
2. Received metadata referencing `broker.id = 1` ✅
3. Tried to route request to broker.id = 1 ❌
4. Could not resolve broker.id → endpoint mapping ❌
5. Crashed with `BrokerNotFound` error

### Why Java Clients Often Work
The official Kafka Java client:
- More tolerant of broker indirection
- Re-resolves metadata aggressively
- Has defensive fallback logic
- Better handles broker ID inconsistencies

KafkaJS is stricter and expects traditional Kafka behavior.

## Our Solution: KafScale-Compatible Configuration

See [src/kafka.js](src/kafka.js) for the complete implementation.

### Key Configuration Changes

#### 1. Frequent Metadata Refresh
```javascript
metadataMaxAge: 30000 // 30 seconds
```
Forces frequent metadata updates to handle KafScale's dynamic broker model.

#### 2. Conservative Retry Logic
```javascript
retry: {
  retries: 10,
  initialRetryTime: 300,
  maxRetryTime: 30000,
  multiplier: 2,
  factor: 0.2
}
```
Handles transient broker routing issues gracefully.

#### 3. Extended Timeouts
```javascript
connectionTimeout: 10000,
requestTimeout: 30000
```
Gives KafScale time to route requests through its abstraction layer.

#### 4. Single-Partition Concurrency
```javascript
// In consumer config
sessionTimeout: 30000,
rebalanceTimeout: 60000,
heartbeatInterval: 3000
```
Works best with KafScale's single logical broker model.

#### 5. Silenced Warnings
```javascript
process.env.KAFKAJS_NO_PARTITIONER_WARNING = '1'
```
Removes noise from KafkaJS v2 partitioner changes.

## Recommended Topic Configuration

For KafScale, use **fewer partitions** than you would with Apache Kafka:

```bash
# Good for KafScale
kafka-topics --create --topic agent_requests --partitions 3

# Overkill for KafScale (but works)
kafka-topics --create --topic agent_requests --partitions 50
```

Why? KafScale scales horizontally without needing many partitions. The platform handles distribution internally.

## Testing KafScale Compatibility

### Run the E2E Test
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start agent
make run-agent

# Terminal 2: Run test
make test-e2e
```

The test verifies:
- ✅ Producer can connect and send messages
- ✅ Consumer can subscribe and receive messages
- ✅ Full workflow completes end-to-end
- ✅ No broker routing errors
- ✅ Responses are properly correlated

### Expected Output

## Architecture Recommendations

### ✅ DO: Treat KafScale as Single Logical Broker
```javascript
// Client connects to one endpoint
brokers: ['127.0.0.1:29092']

// Platform handles scaling internally
// You don't need to manage broker IDs
```

### ✅ DO: Use Fewer Partitions
```bash
# 3 partitions is plenty
--partitions 3
```

### ✅ DO: Rely on Platform Scaling
Let KafScale handle horizontal scaling internally. You get "infinite brokers" behind one address.

### ❌ DON'T: Assume Multi-Broker Client Patterns
```javascript
// Don't try to route to specific broker IDs
// Don't assume 1:1 mapping of broker ID → endpoint
// Don't use rack-aware clients
```

### ❌ DON'T: Over-Partition Topics
You don't need 50+ partitions. KafScale scales differently than Apache Kafka.

## Client Compatibility Matrix

| Client | KafScale Compatible | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|-------|
| **KafkaJS** (this demo) | ✅ Yes* | Requires configuration tuning (see above) |
| **Kafka Java Client** | ✅ Yes | Usually works out of the box |
| **librdkafka** | ✅ Yes | C/C++/Python/Go - generally compatible |
| **confluent-kafka-python** | ✅ Yes | Built on librdkafka |
| **kafka-go** | ⚠️ Maybe | Depends on implementation |

*This demo includes all necessary configuration for KafScale compatibility.

## Debugging Tips

### If you see `BrokerNotFound` errors:

1. **Check metadata age:**
   ```javascript
   metadataMaxAge: 30000 // Increase if needed
   ```

2. **Verify single endpoint:**
   ```json
   {
     "brokers": ["127.0.0.1:29092"]
   }
   ```
   One address only!

3. **Enable debug logging:**
   ```bash
   KAFKA_LOG_LEVEL=5 make run-agent
   ```

4. **Test connectivity:**
   ```bash
   make check-kafka
   ```

### If you see timeout warnings:

This is usually metadata inconsistency. The fix:
- Increase `metadataMaxAge`
- Increase retry times
- Verify broker configuration

### If messages don't arrive:

1. **Check topics exist:**
   ```bash
   make topics
   ```

2. **Run E2E test:**
   ```bash
   make test-e2e
   ```

3. **Check agent is running:**
   ```bash
   # Should see: "🎧 Agent started, waiting for tasks..."
   make run-agent
   ```

## Summary

**The key insight:** KafScale is "one broker IP, infinite scaling behind it."

KafkaJS needs to be configured to treat it as such:
- Frequent metadata refresh
- Conservative timeouts
- Single-broker semantics

With these changes, KafkaJS works perfectly with KafScale! ✅
