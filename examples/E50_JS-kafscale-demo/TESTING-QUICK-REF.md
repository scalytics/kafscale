# Testing Quick Reference

## 🎯 Mixed Client Tests (Recommended for Debugging)

These tests help isolate whether issues are in producer, consumer, or broker.

### Test 1: KafkaJS Producer → kcat Consumer

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
make kcat-consume
# or: kcat -b 127.0.0.1:39092 -t agent_requests -C
```

**Terminal 2:**
```bash
make test-producer
# or: npm run test:producer
```

**What it tests:** Can KafkaJS write messages that native tools can read?

---

### Test 2: kcat Producer → KafkaJS Consumer

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
make test-consumer
# or: npm run test:consumer
```

**Terminal 2:**
```bash
echo '{"test":"hello"}' | kcat -b 127.0.0.1:39092 -t agent_requests -P
# or: make kcat-produce (then type message)
```

**What it tests:** Can KafkaJS read messages from native producers?

---

### Test 3: Full E2E (KafkaJS → Agent → KafkaJS)

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
make run-agent
```

**Terminal 2:**
```bash
make test-e2e
# or: npm test
```

**What it tests:** Complete workflow with KafkaJS only.

## 📊 Interpretation Matrix

| Test 1 | Test 2 | Test 3 | Diagnosis |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **Everything works!** |
| ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | KafkaJS **producer** broken |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | KafkaJS **consumer** broken |
| ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | KafkaJS incompatible with broker |
| ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Agent logic issue (not client) |

## 🔧 Quick Commands

### Run Tests
```bash
make test-producer          # Test KafkaJS producer
make test-consumer          # Test KafkaJS consumer
make test-e2e               # Full E2E test
npm run debug:metadata      # Check broker metadata
```

### Native Tools
```bash
make kcat-consume           # Start kcat consumer
make kcat-produce           # Start kcat producer
make topics                 # List topics
```

### Check Connectivity
```bash
lsof -i :39092              # Is broker listening?
nc -zv 127.0.0.1 39092      # Can we connect?
```

## 🐛 Common Issues

### "ECONNREFUSED"
- Broker not running on expected port
- Check: `lsof -i :39092`

### "BrokerNotFound"
- Metadata issue (broker ID mismatch)
- Check: `npm run debug:metadata`

### Message sent but not received
- Run Test 1 & 2 to isolate which direction fails
- Check topic exists: `make topics`
