# Quick Start Guide - Agent Kanban Board

## 🎯 What You'll See

A modern Kanban board interface where you can:
- Create tasks for your AI agent
- Drag tasks to trigger processing
- Watch the agent work in real-time
- See results appear automatically

## 🚀 Run It Now (2 Steps)

### 1. Install and Setup
```bash
cd examples/E50_JS-kafscale-demo
make install
make setup
```

### 2. Start Services (2 Terminals)

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
make run-agent
```

**Terminal 2:**
```bash
make run-web
```

### 3. Open Browser
Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000**

## 💡 Using the Kanban Board

### Create a Task
1. Click **"+ New Task"** button
2. Enter:
   - **Task**: "Write a blog post about Kafka"
   - **Spec**: "800 words, markdown format"
   - **Context**: "For developers learning Kafka"
3. Click **"Create Task"**

### Process the Task
1. Your task appears in the **📥 Backlog** lane
2. **Drag** the card to the **⚙️ Agent Processing** lane
3. The card is sent to Kafka immediately
4. Watch the right panel:
   - **Current Task** shows what the agent is working on
   - **Prompt Built** displays the LLM prompt
   - **LLM Processing** indicator shows activity

### See the Result
1. When complete, the card automatically moves to **✅ Completed**
2. Click the card to see the full response
3. The task appears in the **Task History** on the right

## 🎨 UI Features

### Left Panel: Task Board
- **Backlog**: New tasks waiting
- **Agent Processing**: Tasks being processed (drag here!)
- **Completed**: Finished tasks with results

### Right Panel: Agent Monitor
- **Current Task**: What's being worked on now
- **Prompt Built**: The actual LLM prompt
- **LLM Processing**: Real-time status
- **Task History**: Last 10 completed tasks

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit `config/agent-config.json` to change:
- Kafka broker address (currently: `127.0.0.1:39092`)
- Topic names
- Agent system prompt
- LLM settings

## 🛠️ Replace the LLM Stub

The demo uses a stubbed LLM. To use real AI:

1. Install provider SDK:
```bash
npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk
# or
npm install openai
```

2. Edit `src/llm.js` and replace the `callLLM` function

3. Restart the agent:
```bash
make run-agent
```

## 📊 What's Happening Behind the Scenes

1. **Task Creation** → Message sent to Kafka `agent_requests` topic
2. **Agent Service** → Consumes from `agent_requests`
3. **LLM Call** → Processes with stubbed/real LLM
4. **Response** → Published to `agent_responses` topic
5. **Web UI** → Receives via WebSocket and updates card

## 🎓 Next Steps

Try these experiments:
- [ ] Create multiple tasks and drag them all to processing
- [ ] Edit `config/agent-config.json` to change the system prompt
- [ ] Replace the LLM stub with a real API
- [ ] Open multiple browser tabs (all sync in real-time!)
- [ ] Add custom CSS to change the theme

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Can't connect to Kafka?**
```bash
# Check your config
cat config/agent-config.json

# Make sure Kafka/KafScale is running on the configured port
```

**Agent not processing?**
```bash
# Verify agent is running
# Terminal 1 should show: "🎧 Agent started, waiting for tasks..."
```

**Web UI not loading?**
```bash
# Check web server is running
# Terminal 2 should show: "🚀 Web Server Started"
# Try: http://localhost:3000
```
