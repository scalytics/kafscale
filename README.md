Kafscale™ is a Kafka-protocol compatible streaming platform built for durable message transport without the operational complexity of stateful Kafka clusters. It is open source under the Apache 2.0 license and implemented in Go. (Kafscale is not a registered trademark.)

## Why Kafscale Exists

Most Kafka deployments act as durable pipes: producers write, consumers read, teams rely on replay when something breaks. Very few workloads require sub-millisecond latency, exactly-once transactions, or compacted topics, yet traditional Kafka clusters still demand stateful brokers, disk management, and continuous operational effort.

Kafscale targets the common case by keeping brokers stateless and putting durability in S3 while remaining compatible with existing Kafka clients and tooling.

Kafscale is used in production environments, but there are no warranties or guarantees.

## Design Scope

In scope:
- Kafka wire protocol for core produce, fetch, and consumer group APIs
- Immutable S3-backed segment storage
- Stateless broker pods
- etcd-backed metadata, offsets, and consumer group state
- Kubernetes-native operation via the operator

Explicit non-goals:
- Exactly-once semantics and transactions
- Compacted topics
- Kafka internal replication protocols
- Embedded stream processing inside the broker

Stream processing is expected to run in external compute engines such as Apache Flink or Apache Wayang.

## Architecture at a Glance

- Brokers handle Kafka protocol traffic and buffer segments in memory.
- S3 stores immutable log segments and index files (source of truth).
- etcd stores metadata, offsets, and consumer group state.

For the technical specification and data formats, see `kafscale-spec.md`.
