# KAFSQL Processor (Draft)

KAFSQL is a storage-native SQL processor that reads Kafscale KFS segments from
S3 and exposes a Postgres wire protocol endpoint for ad-hoc queries. It is
stateless, uses S3 as source of truth, and targets the 80% of Kafka data
questions that are simple and time-bounded.

## What It Will Do (v0.6 scope)

- Read KFS segments directly from S3 (no broker dependency).
- Expose Postgres wire protocol for JDBC/BI compatibility.
- Support single-topic queries plus bounded two-topic joins.
- Provide Kafka-native SQL extensions (`LAST`, `TAIL`, `SCAN FULL`).

## What It Will Not Do (v0.6)

- Continuous streaming queries or materialized views.
- Full SQL feature parity or multi-join chains.
- Writes or updates.

```
make build
./bin/sql-processor -config config/config.yaml
```

## Config Example

s3:
  bucket: kafscale-data
  namespace: production

metadata:
  discovery: etcd

server:
  listen: ":5432"
```
