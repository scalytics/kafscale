# MCP Service

This document sketches a Model Context Protocol (MCP) service for Kafscale.
The goal is to enable safe, structured, agent-friendly operations without
embedding MCP into brokers or widening the broker attack surface.

For an ops-focused guide and integration examples, see `docs/ops-mcp.md`.

## Goals

- Provide read-only observability for ops debugging and reporting.
- Offer a path to mutation tools once broker/admin auth exists.
- Ship as a separate service (`kafscale-mcp`), not embedded in brokers.

## Non-Goals

- No direct embedding in the broker process.
- No unauthenticated mutation tools.
- No replacement for Kafka protocol or admin APIs.

## Architecture

- Standalone MCP service deployed alongside Kafscale.
- Talks to Kafscale via:
  - Metadata store access (read-only).
  - Prometheus metrics scraping.
  - Optional gRPC control plane (future, gated).
- Deployed as an optional Helm chart and disabled by default.
- Helm defaults to a dedicated namespace for the MCP service.

## Service Shape

- HTTP endpoint: `/mcp` using MCP streamable HTTP transport (SSE).
- Health check: `/healthz`.
- Read-only tools only; mutation tools are not registered.

Environment variables:

- `KAFSCALE_MCP_HTTP_ADDR` (default `:8090`)
- `KAFSCALE_MCP_ETCD_ENDPOINTS` (comma-separated)
- `KAFSCALE_MCP_ETCD_USERNAME`
- `KAFSCALE_MCP_ETCD_PASSWORD`
- `KAFSCALE_MCP_BROKER_METRICS_URL` (Prometheus metrics endpoint)
- `KAFSCALE_MCP_SESSION_TIMEOUT` (optional, duration string)
- `KAFSCALE_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` (optional bearer token; if unset, server is open)

## v1 Tool Surface

Read-only tools (default):

- `cluster_status` (summary view; similar to console status).
- `cluster_metrics` (S3 latency, produce/fetch RPS, admin error rates).
- `list_topics` / `describe_topics`.
- `list_groups` / `describe_group`.
- `fetch_offsets` (consumer group offsets).
- `describe_configs` (topic configs).

Mutation tools (future, gated by auth + RBAC):

- `create_topic` / `delete_topic`.
- `create_partitions`.
- `update_topic_config`.
- `delete_group`.
- Broker control actions (drain/flush) via gRPC control plane.

## Security and Guardrails

Kafscale currently does not enforce auth on broker/admin APIs. For MCP, we
must ship secure-by-default to avoid "one prompt away from prod changes".

Requirements:

- Strong auth (OIDC or short-lived tokens). No static shared secrets.
- RBAC and allowlist tool sets (separate observe vs mutate).
- Audit logs for every tool call (who/what/when + diff).
- Dry-run mode for all mutations.
- Environment fences (production requires explicit break-glass or approval).

See `docs/security.md` for the current security posture and roadmap; MCP should
not enable any operations that bypass the auth/authorization roadmap there.

## Rollout Plan

- Phase 1: Read-only MCP server with auth and audit logging.
- Phase 2: Mutations behind RBAC + dry-run + approval workflows.

Current status:

- Read-only MCP server is implemented.
- Optional bearer token auth is supported; stronger auth and audit logging remain pending.

## Open Questions

- Which auth provider(s) to standardize (OIDC provider and token format).
- Where to store audit logs (stdout, file, or external sink).
- Whether to expose broker control actions in v1 or v2.
